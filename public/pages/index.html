          <p class="intro-text">
            Since February 2022 I've embarked on a self-taught journey to
            becoming a professional programmer. Through dedicated and continuous
            learning I've progressed from an aspiring enthusiast to a proficient
            web developer.
          </p>

          <p class="intro-text">
            My self-motivated learning approach has equipped me with the ability
            to adapt quickly to new technologies and frameworks. I constantly
            challenge myself to expand my skill set. Throughout my learning
            journey, I have undertaken several personal projects and
            <span id="cert">accquired a certificate</span> in responsive web
            design to solidify my skills and showcase my capabilities.
          </p>

          <p class="intro-text">
            In addition to my self-taught experience, I have also gained
            valuable industry exposure during my time at Oasco Solutions. As a
            Software Developer, I spent three months contributing to the
            development of tools using JavaScript and responsive web pages with
            Webflow. This experience further refined my technical skills and
            provided me with hands-on experience working within a professional
            software development environment. Furthermore, to continue enhancing
            my skills and knowledge in the field, I've decided to pursue a
            Computer Science degree, which will offer me a solid foundation and
            a deeper understanding of the principles underpinning web
            development and software engineering
          </p>

          <p id="circle" class="intro-text">
            I possess a proficient understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
            Python, which have served as the foundation of my technical
            expertise. Additionally, I have gained practical experience with
            React, Angular, Django, and various libraries.
